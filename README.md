#P3 Behavior Cloning
The objective of this project is to clone the human's driving behavior using the car simulator and the convolutional neural network (CNN). To collect data to train the CNN, we use the simulator to record frame-by-frame images of the track and the corresponding steering angles input by the driver. A properly trained CNN is expected to use the image as an input and predicts the steering angle as an output. As a result, the car in the simulator can continuously drive itself on the road without going off-track in the autonomous mode.
